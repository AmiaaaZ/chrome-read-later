A Chrome extension focuses on reading later, rather than closing and removing.

## Features
- **Read Later**: Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> or right click and select `Read Later` to add current tab or link in the reading list.
- **No delete or close**: The tab will be closed when you add it, the link will be removed when you click to read it.
- **Clear**: A button to remove all the links.

## Installation

1. Move it to the safe path(you won't delete it accidentally).
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Open `Developer mode`.
4. Click `Load unpacked` and select the folder.
